● Save in any persistence store. 
● Fetch any five random quizzes from the persistence store and show one by one on the next screen. One quiz question should be shown at a time(Capitalize questions and options, if required). 
● There should be a 10 seconds timer for every question. Wrong answer or failing to answer in stipulated time will deduct 10 points and the correct answer will add 20 points + seconds left from the timer. 
Eg: If a person answers in 4 seconds, points to be credited would be 20(Correct answer point) + 6(seconds left before the correct answer was selected).
